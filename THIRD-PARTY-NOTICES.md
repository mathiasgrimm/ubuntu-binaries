# Third-party notices

This package distributes pre-compiled binaries built from third-party open source
projects. The MIT license in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) covers **only this repository's own
build scripts** (the Makefile and the Dockerfiles). It does **not** cover the binaries
in `bin/` - each of those is governed by its upstream project's license, listed below.

**Several of the binaries are copyleft (GPL).** If you redistribute this package, or
redistribute an application that bundles these binaries, those licenses impose
obligations on you - most notably passing along the license text and making the
corresponding source available. See [Source code](#source-code) below.

### Why ffmpeg and ffprobe are GPL, not LGPL

FFmpeg is LGPL-2.1-or-later by default. This package builds it with `--enable-gpl`
plus `--enable-libx264` and `--enable-libx265`. Per FFmpeg's own
[`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/n9.0.2/LICENSE.md):

> Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License
> version 2 or later (GPL v2+). […] None of these parts are used by default, you have
> to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to configure to activate them. In this case,
> FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.

Additionally, x264 is `GPL-2.0-or-later` and x265 is `GPL-2.0`. Because x265 does not
offer the "or later" option, the practical effect for the combined `ffmpeg` and
`ffprobe` binaries shipped here is GPL-2.0. Commercial licenses for x264 and x265 are
available from their respective vendors if you need to avoid the GPL.

### qpdf is Apache-2.0, and carries a NOTICE

`qpdf` is the only binary here under the Apache License 2.0. Nothing in its static link
closure carries a copyleft obligation: zlib, libjpeg-turbo and musl are permissive, and
libstdc++ and libgcc are `GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1`, whose Runtime Library
Exception permits conveying the combination "under terms of your choice, consistent with
the licensing of the Independent Modules" - here Apache-2.0 and permissive. `qpdf` is
therefore **not** covered by the corresponding-source offer below.

It does carry obligations of its own. Apache-2.0 section 4(d) requires anyone
redistributing a work that includes a `NOTICE` file to pass that file's attribution text
along. qpdf ships one, reproduced verbatim at
[`licenses/qpdf-NOTICE.txt`](licenses/qpdf-NOTICE.txt). It covers qpdf's own copyright,
the option to treat pre-v7 qpdf as Artistic-2.0, a qtest attribution (qtest is a test
harness and is not part of the shipped binary), and the Rijndael and sha2 code described
below.

**One required attribution is absent from that NOTICE.** qpdf's native crypto provider
also compiles `libqpdf/MD5_native.cc`, which states that it "is derived from the reference
algorithm for MD5 as given in RFC 1321" and is licensed under `RSA-MD`. Because it is a
derivative work, the operative clause is the second of that license's two grants:

> License is also granted to make and use derivative works provided that such works are
> identified as "derived from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" in
> all material mentioning or referencing the derived work.

Upstream's `NOTICE.md` does not mention this component, so reproducing the NOTICE alone
does not discharge the requirement. Accordingly, and using the license's own words:

> `bin/qpdf` contains code derived from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest
> Algorithm.

`RSA-MD` further requires that "these notices must be retained in any copies of any part
of this documentation and/or software". The complete notice - both grants, the copyright
line, and the warranty disclaimer - is reproduced at
[`licenses/RSA-MD.txt`](licenses/RSA-MD.txt).

qpdf can optionally delegate encryption to GnuTLS (`LGPL-2.1-or-later`) or OpenSSL -
`Apache-2.0` from OpenSSL 3.0 onward, but qpdf accepts `openssl >= 1.1.0`, and those
older releases are under the OpenSSL and SSLeay licenses instead. Neither provider
compiles `MD5_native.cc`. This build uses neither: it is configured with
`-DUSE_IMPLICIT_CRYPTO=OFF -DREQUIRE_CRYPTO_NATIVE=ON`, which keeps full AES-256 support
without statically linking an LGPL library. The trade is the RSA-MD attribution above.

## Statically linked components

All binaries are statically linked, so each one also contains code from its
dependencies. The notable ones, by binary:

| Binary | Statically linked components |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `jpegoptim` | libjpeg-turbo (`IJG AND BSD-3-Clause AND Zlib`) |
| `optipng` | libpng (`Libpng`), zlib (`Zlib`), cexcept (`Zlib`, [license](licenses/cexcept.txt)), minitiff/pnmio (`BSL-1.0`, [license](licenses/BSL-1.0.txt)) |
| `pngquant` | libpng, zlib, Little CMS (`MIT`, [license](licenses/lcms2.txt)), from the Alpine `lcms2-static` package at pngquant's build time, not the pinned 2.19.1 used by `magick` |
| `cwebp`, `dwebp` | libpng, libjpeg-turbo, giflib (`MIT`), zlib |
| `avifenc`, `avifdec` | dav1d `1.5.4` (`BSD-2-Clause`, [license](licenses/dav1d.txt)), libaom (`BSD-2-Clause` + AOM patent license), libargparse (`MIT`, [license](licenses/libargparse.txt)), libpng, libjpeg-turbo, zlib |
| `gifsicle` | - |
| `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` | x264 (`GPL-2.0-or-later`), x265 `4.1` (`GPL-2.0`), libvpx `v1.15.0` (`BSD-3-Clause`), Opus `v1.5.2` (`BSD-3-Clause`), libwebp `v1.6.0` (`BSD-3-Clause`, [license](licenses/libwebp.txt)), LAME (`LGPL-2.1-or-later`), FreeType (`FTL OR GPL-2.0-or-later`), libpng, zlib, bzip2 (`bzip2-1.0.6`), Brotli (`MIT`) |
| `magick` | Little CMS `2.19.1` (`MIT`, [license](licenses/lcms2.txt)), libjpeg-turbo, libpng, libwebp, FreeType, libxml2 (`MIT`), libtiff `v4.7.0`, zlib, xz/liblzma (`0BSD`), bzip2, Brotli |
| `zstd` | zlib, xz/liblzma, LZ4 (`BSD-2-Clause`) |
| `qpdf` | zlib, libjpeg-turbo, and qpdf's built-in crypto provider: Rijndael/AES (public domain), sha2 from sphlib (`MIT`), MD5 derived from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm (`RSA-MD`) |

Every gcc-built binary above also contains libgcc, and `avifenc`, `avifdec`, `qpdf`, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`
additionally contain libstdc++ - qpdf and libargparse use C++, and ffmpeg/ffprobe pull it in through x265.
(`magick` is C and contains neither libstdc++ nor any other C++ runtime. `pngquant` is
built with Rust rather than gcc, so it carries the `compiler_builtins` crate
- `Apache-2.0 OR MIT` - in place of libgcc.) Both GCC libraries are
`GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1`. The GCC Runtime Library Exception permits
conveying such a combination "under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of
the Independent Modules", so their presence adds no copyleft obligation of its own -
`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are GPL for unrelated reasons, via x264 and x265.

Unversioned components above are the Alpine Linux packages current at build time; the
`alpine:3.23` base image and its `apk` packages are not pinned, so exact versions
vary by build date. Primary upstream tool versions and the dav1d version/commit are pinned in the
`Makefile`, as are the Little CMS tag and commit. Its Dockerfile verifies that commit. The [AVIF build record](avifenc/BUILD.md) lists the dependency versions
used for the shipped AVIF artifacts.

## Source code

The complete corresponding source for every binary is the upstream project at the
version pinned in the table above, combined with the build scripts in this repository
(`Makefile` and `<tool>/Dockerfile`), which are included in the distributed package.
Each Dockerfile clones its upstream source at an exact tag and records the full
configure and build flags used.

**Written offer.** For a period of three years from the date you received this
package, the copyright holder of this repository will, on request, provide a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code for the GPL-licensed binaries
it distributes (`jpegoptim`, `pngquant`, `gifsicle`, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`), on a medium
customarily used for software interchange, for no more than the cost of physically
performing the distribution. Send requests to <mathiasgrimm@gmail.com>, naming the
package version you received.

## Disclaimer

This summary is provided in good faith and is not legal advice. It reflects the
licenses of the pinned upstream versions at the time of writing. If you redistribute
these binaries - particularly in a commercial product - review the obligations
yourself, and re-check this file after any version bump in the `Makefile`.
